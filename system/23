In the VM, a user has to be made as follows:
adduser <newuser>
A series of questions are asked, one of which is the password
for the new user. Be sure to keep that password for later use.
On the Mac, login through the normal ssh process, but include
the username of the new user:
ssh -p <port> <newuser>@<hostname>
ssh -p 4242 surfaceplate@localhost
A request will be made for the newuser's password. If the
password is correctly inputed, a ssh connection will have been
established, which can be verified by use of the whoami command

On a gui app for ssh, select a user from the list of available
users, and when prompted, input the correct password.
